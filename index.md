I am a medic, a clinical epidemiologist, and a population health scientist with a strong interest in the genetic and environmental risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases in the Mexican population.

Currently, I hold an Early Career Research Fellowship at [Oxford Population Health](https://www.ndph.ox.ac.uk/), where I work with the [Mexico City Prospective Study](https://www.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/research/prospective-blood-based-study-of-150-000-individuals-in-mexico) team led by Prof Jonathan Emberson.
